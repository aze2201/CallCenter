This is a poll app, similar to doodle or dudle, for Nextcloud written in PHP and JS / jQuery.
It is a rework of the already existing [polls app](https://github.com/raduvatav/polls) written by @raduvatav.

**Note**: ownCloud is **no longer** supported! Last (confirmed) working version is 0.8.1 and is released in the oC marketplace.
**Note**: IE11 users will face some CSS problems (see #541). Please change to a compatible browser (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, etc.)

### Features
- :bar_chart: Create / edit polls (datetimes _and_ texts)
- :date: Set expiration date
- :lock: Restrict access (only logged in users, certain groups / users, hidden and public)
- :speech_balloon: Comments
